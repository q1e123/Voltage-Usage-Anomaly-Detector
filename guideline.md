# Guideline
This will (most probably) be updated during the semester. 

## Project
1. If you have suggestions, tell me.

## Code
1. Use snake_case.
1. Variables should be lower case, constants upper case
1. Use descriptive variable names.
1. Write code that is easy to understand. If you need comments to make somebody to understand, the code is not clean enough.
1. Write modular code.
1. I've written the headers of main functions. If you need to change something make other functions.

## Git
1. Use **develop** branch (You can also use feature branches).
1. Test your code before pushing it.
1. Commit small chuncks of code. Don't commit all of your code at once.
